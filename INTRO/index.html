                <p>A pika (/ˈpaɪkə/ PY-kə; archaically spelled pica) is a small, mountain-dwelling mammal found in
                    Asia and North America. With short limbs, very round body, an even coat of fur, and no external
                    tail, they resemble their close relative, the rabbit, but with short, rounded ears.[3] The
                    large-eared pika of the Himalayas and nearby mountains is found at heights of more than 6,000 m
                    (20,000 ft), among the highest of any mammal.</p>
